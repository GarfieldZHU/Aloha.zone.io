## Story about NVidia



## Introduce GPU

### Architecture

### How GPU works

### Compare with CPU

### Read GPU Spec

To better understand how the GPU performs, we should learn to read the spec of GPU of the core metrics.

We can find the centralized parameter specs of GPUs at the 3rd party: https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/


Or the details in the official website of the GPU manufacturer (NVidia, AMD, and Intel), e.g.

- [RTX 4090](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/)
- [Radeon RX 7900 XTX](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-7900xtx)
- [Intel Arc A770](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/229151/intel-arc-a770-graphics-16gb/specifications.html)


#### Memory

The memory of GPU is called **VRAM** (Video RAM).

- Memory type & size

- Memory Bus Width * BandWidth


#### Bus & Clock

#### TMU

TMU stands for Texture Mapping Unit. It is a component of the video card or GPU that is responsible for mapping textures to polygons. It is a part of the rendering pipeline.

#### TFLOPS

TFLOPS (teraFLOPS) is the tera (10^12) **FL**oating point **O**perations **P**er **S**econd.

Generally, we say in 32-bit floating point.

> GFLOPS, as we can guess, is the giga (10^9) of FLOPS. It was used in years ago and now we are in TFLOPS era.

| Platform | TFLOPS |
| ------ | ------ |
| PS5    |  10.28 |
| XBOX Series X |  12.00 |
| Nitendo Switch | 0.4 / 0.5 (Docked) |
| Intel UHD Graphics 770 | 0.742 |
| Intel Arc A770 | 19.66 |
| AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT | 37.32 |
| AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX | 61.42 |
| GeForce RTX 2080 Ti | 13.45 |
| GeForce RTX 3090 | 35.58 |
| GeForce RTX 4070 Ti | 40.09 |
| GeForce RTX 4090 | 82.58 |
