Some interesting facts and knowledge points in learning Rust.

## Struct and Trait

Think different from **class** concept in C++ or Java, data and method are separated in Rust. 

#### 1. No inheritance, but composition for struct. 
   
   For data in struct, Rust do not have inheritance, but recommend composition. 
   
   Given a struct B is composed by another struct A:
   ```rust
   struct StructA {
     x: i32;
   };
   struct StructB {
     a: StructA, 
     // other fields...
   };
   ```
   We have a instance of B `let b: B;`, then wecan access A's member via: `b.a.x;`
   
   Or, if we do not like the indirect way, but want a inherited style like a direct `b.x`, using the [Deref](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html) and [DerefMut](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html) traits will make it possible. 
   ```rust
   impl std::ops::Deref for StructB {
     type Target = StructA;
     fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
       &self.a
     }
   }
   ```
   Then, we can make it real.
   ```rust
   let b = StructB { a: StructA };
   println!("{}", b.x);
   ```

#### 2. Trait and `dyn`
   
   Trait is a group of shared behavior, which looks like the concept `interface`. 
   
   Typically we use `implement Trait for Struct` to attach the methods to data. But since 1.0, Trait is used in double contexts. 
   - As a trait: what is original designed, like:
     ```rust
     impl MyTrait for StructA {}
     ```
   - As a type: trait itself should also be allowed to be implemented, or implement other traits for it:
     ```rust
     impl MyTrait {}
     impl AnotherTrait for MyTrait {}
     ```
     Implement a trait, is just like making a "[interface default method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html)" in Java. 
     And implement trait for trait is used for using the methods in trait to implement another trait. 
     
     However, traits are actually unsized / dynamically-sized (or say "abstract"), using it as type leads to complex runtime errors. 
     
     To resolve this, `dyn` is introduced since 1.27. Read [RFC 2113](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2113-dyn-trait-syntax.md) for more details.
     <br/>
     It makes the real type of the trait object (used as type) to be decided at runtime via [dynamic dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch)
     
     ```rust
      trait Printable {
          fn stringify(&self) -> String;
      }

      impl Printable for i32 {
          fn stringify(&self) -> String { self.to_string() }
      }

      fn print(a: Box<dyn Printable>) {
          println!("{}", a.stringify());
      }

      fn main() {
          print(Box::new(10) as Box<dyn Printable>);
      }     
     
     ```
  
  * See [the answer for *dyn*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50650070/what-does-dyn-mean-in-a-type) on StackOverflow.


#### 3. Trait Bounds and Supertrait
   
- [Bounds](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/bounds.html)

   The above section mentioned `dyn` which decorates a trait to be a type. It's useful, but not always enough. 
   
   Generics are much more expressive in type definition, and we can also need stipulate what functionality a generic type implements. 
   
   Bounds is what we can use trait to restrict what the generic needs to implement.
   
   ```rust
   // Bounds Sample:
   fn printer<T: Display>(t: T) {
    println!("{}", t);
   }
   ```
   The bounds are common in other languages (typically uses keyword `extends`), like the [Bounded Type in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html), [Generic Constraints](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#generic-constraints), etc.
   
   Bounds allows muliple traits (with `+` operator), and `where` clause to be more expressive. 
   
- [Supertraits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/supertraits.html)
   
  Rust doesn't have "inheritance", but you can define a trait as being a superset of another trait.
  
  It's easy to understand since the supertraits just like the syntax of "extends" of "interface" (not class) in Java. It means: 1) implement the subtrait (child interface) must implement all methods in supertrait (parent interface); 2) one trait can have multiple supertrait.

  ```rust
   trait Person {
       fn name(&self) -> String;
   }

   // Person is a supertrait of Student.
   // Implementing Student requires you to also impl Person.
   trait Student: Person {
       fn university(&self) -> String;
   }

   trait Programmer {
       fn fav_language(&self) -> String;
   }

   // CompSciStudent (computer science student) is a subtrait of both Programmer 
   // and Student. Implementing CompSciStudent requires you to impl both supertraits.
   trait CompSciStudent: Programmer + Student {
       fn git_username(&self) -> String;
   }
   
   /** Showcase of using an object with multiple supertraits */
   fn comp_sci_student_greeting(student: &dyn CompSciStudent) -> String {
    format!(
        "My name is {} and I attend {}. My favorite language is {}. My Git username is {}",
        student.name(),
        student.university(),
        student.fav_language(),
        student.git_username()
    )
  }
  ```

#### 4. Polymorphism
  
  Polymorphism is real an important mechansim to make abstraction and reduce redundant code, no matter in OOP or FP. Though we have no inheritance for struct, but we can do polymorphism. 
  
  The above two sections mentioned: 
     
     a. `dyn`, which runs dynamic dispatch mechanism. 
     
     b. Geneirc bounds, which use trait to stipulate what functionality a type implements.
  
   That's how polymorphism works in Rust. Use `t: dyn Trait` as the type of signature, the `t.someMethod()` will be dynamically decided using which implemention of Trait.
     
   Example:
   ```rust
      struct Circle {
        radius: f64
      }
      struct Rectangle {
        height: f64,
        width: f64
      }

      trait Shape {
        fn area(&self) -> f64;
      }

      impl Shape for Circle {
        fn area(&self) -> f64 {
          PI * self.radius * self.radius
        }
      }
      impl Shape for Rectangle {
        fn area(&self) -> f64 {
          self.height * self.width
        }
      }
      
      // Polymorphism with "dyn" trait type
      fn print_area(shape: &dyn Shape) {
        println!("{}", shape.area());
      }
      
      // Polymorphism by bounds on generic type 
      fn print_area_generic<T: Shape> (shape: &T) {
        println!("{}", shape.area());
      }
      
      fn main() {
        let circle = Circle{radius: 2.0};
        let rectangle = Rectangle{height: 3.0, width: 5.0};
        print_area(&circle); // 12.5664
        print_area(&rectangle); // 15
        print_area_generic(&circle); // 12.5664
        print_area_generic(&rectangle); // 15
      }
   ```



#### 5. Delegate boxed/wrapped struct to trait object

   * See [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33041736/trait-implementation-for-both-a-trait-object-and-for-direct-implementors-of-the) on StackOverflow.

   It is widely used for convenience, we may have some structs encapulate the other types with trait implemented. And we want the implemented trait could be used on the wrapper struct. 
   
   The most common case is like `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`.
   
   A widely used practise is implement trait for wrapper structs to delegate the implementation, like this:

   ```rust
   impl<S: Solid + ?Sized> Solid for Box<S> {
       fn intersect(&self, ray: f32) -> f32 {
           (**self).intersect(ray)
           // Some people prefer this less-ambiguous form
           // S::intersect(self, ray)
       }
   }
   ```
   
   Tips: bound `?Sized` is necessary to make it could be optionally sized to support "S" as could be a trait type.
   
 
 
## Formatter
 
 [Formatter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/struct.Formatter.html) trait makes it really simply to construct specific strings. 
 
 It is really useful for building strings or in a CLI tools.  
 
 
#### Fill / Alignment
 
 We need to align (to left or right) the strings with indents or some specific characters to an assigned length, or fill some characters to strings.
 
 Using formatter with fill/alignment syntax is really helpful. It typically looks like `{:0>8}`
 
 - Format syntax for fill/alignment: 
 ```rust
   assert_eq!("00000110", format!("{:0>8}", "110"));
   //                                |||
   //                                ||+-- width
   //                                |+--- align
   //                                +---- fill
 ```
 
 The align bit supports the align mode to left, center and right.
 ```
   < - the argument is left-aligned in width columns
   ^ - the argument is center-aligned in width columns
   > - the argument is right-aligned in width columns
```

 
 Example scenario:
 
 We are implementing `Display` trait for a date time struct, like:
 ```rust
     struct MyDateTime {
       year: i32,
       month: i32,
       day: i32,
       hour: i32,
       minute: i32,
       seconds: i32,
     }
 ```
 The data is in `i32` structure. To display them in a standard format like "dd/MM/yyyy - hh:mm:ss", we need to fill some "0"s for the single-bit data. e.g. "__01/02/2000 - 03:04:05__".
 
 So we can format the data: 
    1. align to right; 
    2. make length to be 2 for day/month/hour/minute/second, and 4 for year; 
    3. fill the bits with "0"s to satify the length;

 Now we have such a formatter for display:
  ```rust
      impl fmt::Display for MyDateTime {
        fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
          write!(f, "{:0>2}/{:0>2}/{:0>4} - {:0>2}:{:0>2}:{:0>2}", 
            self.day, 
            self.month, 
            self.year, 
            self.hour, 
            self.minute, 
            self.second,
          )
        }
      }

 ```
